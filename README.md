# Coin Collector: Recollection Edition

## What is this?
Hello, this is a full-on remake of an older IGM game called "Coin Collector: Recollection Edition".

## What does this include?
This version has various differences compared to the original version, including:

- Names & Descriptions of Buildings, Upgrades, and Achievements are changed to either work in the context of the Mario IP, or make sense to the casual player
- New & Improved Graphics to be more consistent with each other
- Earned Achievements provides small passive boosts upon unloxking them
- Shinies! (not yet available)
- New Buildings, Upgrades, and Achievements exclusive to this version
- Packaged tutorial for newbies & veterans of CC:RE

## Closing Words
I hope you enjoy this as much as I did enjoy playing the original.
