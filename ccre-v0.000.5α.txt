/* DEV NOTES:
	
	-----
	[WHAT IS THIS?]
	
	It is a recreation of the Classic IGM Game "Coin Collector", which is a Mario-Based Idle Incremental Game that gets crazy *very, very fast*; so much so, that you realize that the game has little to do with the Mario Series (save for the Mario-Related Stuff within).	
	The game isn't that great (especially when you compare it to other great IGM Games, like "Wall Destroyer"), but it is very memorable for how crazy it gets.
	
	Since the game is made using Orteil's Old Idle Game Maker Framework, I figured it would be best to port this over to the New Framework (also using this as practice on making IGM Games, so win/win).
	
	I have yet to get permission from lennonluiz0907, but regardless I will still give credit for the Original Project.
	
	[WAIT, HOW COME THERE ARE THINGS MISSING IN THIS VERSION?]
	
	They aren't missing per se, but rather renamed to make more sense (example: "Yoshi Coins" are now called "Dragon Coins", because that is what they're called in the original game lennonluiz based it off of).
	
	Keep in mind that although it doesn't look like everything is ported to here 1:1, everything should function the same as the old version.
	
	[IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE IN TERMS OF CHANGE?]
	
	Yes, as the graphics for the Buttons, Upgrades, Achievements, & Buildings aren't that great (most of them look like they were made in MSPaint; others looks like they were taken from Google Images); I figure I could overhaul the graphics so that they're at least decent.
	
	In terms of Graphics, at the moment I have done most of the Buildings (1-Up Mushrooms all the way to Warps, + Darkness Converters), with 1 Background (might be expanded upon, idk), 1 Unique Upgrade/Achievement Icon(s) (Analog Clock); Reality Converters, Wizards, & Gold Rings are planned to be made very soon (I've already got ideas for the aforementioned Reality Converters).
	
	Besides this, I also plan on having a "Layering" Set-Up for Achievements & Buildings (which is based on "Peanut Butter Cupper"), where the Tiers, Backgrounds, & Icons are in separate sheets overlayed on top of one another.
	
	I also plan on implementing Shinies that *could* fit into Coin Collector (haven't ultimately decided on it YET, but I don't mind the idea of "Star Bits" being involved), and new content beyond that (Wizards never got Achievements in the Original; plan on changing that, at least).
	
	[IS THAT ALL? WHAT ELSE DO YOU PLAN ON DOING?]
	
	I plan to have a list that contains the following changes from the Old IGM Game to the New IGM Game, like the aforementioned "Yoshi Coins".
	
	As it stands right now, this is more of a proof-of-concept that I hope expands out into something great (or at least, decent).
